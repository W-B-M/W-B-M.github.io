The following looks like a lot, but it is simply PDF factorizations and Bayes' rule over and over. Also, notice that the below likelihood factorization appears in hidden Markov models (HMMs) as well (where $X_{t}$ can take on only a finite number of values).  Anyways, suppose we have two processes $\{X_{t}\}$, $\{Y_{t}\}$, where $X_{t}$ denotes the state of a dynamic system at time $t$ and $Y_{t}$ denotes the measurement observed at time $t$. Suppose the system evolves according to the probability density functions (PDFs):
